	<h1>Gel vs Acrylic: Which is Right for You?</h1>
	<p>Both gel and acrylic can look stunning. Here’s how to pick based on your lifestyle and nail health.</p>
	<h3>Durability</h3>
	<p>Acrylics are traditionally harder; gels feel lighter and more natural.</p>
	<h3>Maintenance</h3>
	<p>Both need fills every 2–3 weeks; gels often have a glossier finish.</p>
